<h2 align="center">Mayonnaise Of The Day</h2>

### Backstory
Mayonnaise took over Japan's nation back in the late 90's. Even a term <i>"Mayoler"</i> was born to describe a growing obsession with this condiment by Japanese, particularly among the younger generation.<br>
Fastfoward to 2022 – <i>"Mayoler"</i> is now a commonly used expression, and from my observation, the popularity does not remain within Japan.

To showcase the potential of mayonnaise, MOTD - Mayonnaise Of The Day - was created by the Mayo-Lover, for the Mayo-Lover, of the Mayo-Lover.

### Learning Take-Away
- It was the first time creating a full-stack application using with Typescript – learned a lot of new syntax and error handlings.
- I had several troubles (CORS block, configurations etc) while deploying the project on Heroku. It was a great learning opportunity to search trouble shootings, read documentations, understand what the causes are, and implement the solutions step by step.
- The application's design was based on "my taste" at the beginning. After trying out to use the application on my own, I quickly realized that user interface shouldn't be about "how I like it" – it has to follow "how easily user could navigate themselves to use the application".
